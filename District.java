 * @description
 * You will be implementing an API for a number of parking lots in a district. You will be writing
 * three classes: ParkingLot to track the number of vehicles in an individual lot, PayParkingLot is
 * a type of ParkingLot but also tracks how much money is gathered, and District to track the
 * lots in the parking district. This MUST be done in IntelliJ with Java 11.
 * Since coding to meet a specific API is common in the workforce, in order to reuse other software
 * or hardware, you are being provided with a testing class, that must work without changes other
 * than the package name. You can add attributes and private methods, but you must implement the
 * methods (with the specified parameters) and you must stay consistent with the below
 * requirements.
 *
 * The key operations are
 *
 * markVehicleEntry – called when a vehicle enters a lot, and the requires the number of minutes
 * since the lot opened, and returns an integer ID to identify the car
 *
 * markVehicleExit – called when a vehicle exits a lot, and requires the number of minutes since
 * the lot opened, and the ID of the car that left the lot
 *
 * @language Java 11
 * @bugs no known bugs
