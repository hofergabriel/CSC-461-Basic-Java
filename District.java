 * @description OVERALL PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
 * You will be implementing an API for a number of parking lots in a district. You will be writing
 * three classes: ParkingLot to track the number of vehicles in an individual lot, hofer_gabriel.PayParkingLot is
 * a type of ParkingLot but also tracks how much money is gathered, and hofer_gabriel.District to track the
 * lots in the parking district. This MUST be done in IntelliJ with Java 11.
 * Since coding to meet a specific API is common in the workforce, in order to reuse other software
 * or hardware, you are being provided with a testing class, that must work without changes other
 * than the package name. You can add attributes and private methods, but you must implement the
 * methods (with the specified parameters) and you must stay consistent with the below
 * requirements.
 *
 * The key operations are
 *
 * markVehicleEntry – called when a vehicle enters a lot, and the requires the number of minutes
 * since the lot opened, and returns an integer ID to identify the car
 *
 * markVehicleExit – called when a vehicle exits a lot, and requires the number of minutes since
 * the lot opened, and the ID of the car that left the lot
 *
 * @language Java 11
 * @bugs no known bugs

/**
 * @description DISTRICT CLASS DESCRIPTION
 *hofer_gabriel.District.java purpose is the manage the individual ParkingLots. If any function needs more
 * than one parking lot, it is best done in hofer_gabriel.District.
 * • You must be able to handle a variable number of parking lots using ONE ArrayList of parking lots
 * • The methods markVehicleEntry and markVehicleExit are in hofer_gabriel.District as well, and take
 * an additional parameter in with is parking lot index of which the vehicle is entering or exiting.
 * • The method isClosed for hofer_gabriel.District returns true if and only if all the parking lots are closed at
 * that time.
 * • The method closedMinutes returns the number of minutes that all of the parking lots are
 * closed at the same time. This information would be used to determine if more parking lots are
 * needed.
 * • Add a method add that takes in a Parking Lot, and returns its index.
 * • Add a method getLot which returns the ParkingLot at the given index. You may assume a
 * valid index.
 * • Add a method getVehiclesParkedInDistrict the returns the total number of parked cars
 * in the district.
 * • Add a method getTotalMoneyCollected that returns the total number money collected
 * (rounded to the nearest cent) in the district.
 * You will need to use something similar to if( lot instanceof hofer_gabriel.PayParkingLot) for
 * this to work properly, since your regular and paid parking lots are in the same ArrayList. There is
 * an OOP pattern that can avoid instanceof (which is considered bad practice), but for one
 * task, this is far simpler.
 * • Add a method call isClosed that returns true is ALL parking lots are closed
 * • The value returned by toString must be a string with newline characters embedded in it. For
 * example, toString could return a string such as
 * Status for purple parking lot: 8 vehicles (CLOSED)
 * Status for gold parking lot: 20 vehicles (33.3%)
